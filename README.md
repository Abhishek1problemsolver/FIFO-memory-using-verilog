# FIFO Design in Verilog

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a **First In First Out (FIFO)** memory buffer, along with a testbench for simulation. The FIFO design is parameterized by data width and memory depth, and it includes status flags to indicate when the buffer is full or empty. The project also provides detailed instructions for running the design in a simulation tool.

## Project Overview

The **FIFO (First In First Out)** memory buffer allows data to be stored and retrieved in the order it was written. This is a commonly used data structure in digital systems, particularly for buffering data between components running at different clock speeds.

In this project, the FIFO is implemented in Verilog with support for:
- **Write and Read operations** controlled by `wr_en` and `rd_en` signals.
- **Full and Empty flags** to signal the status of the buffer.
- A parameterized design allowing the user to configure the **data width** and **memory depth**.

A testbench is also provided to verify the functionality of the FIFO by simulating different use cases.

## Features

- **Parameterized Design**: The data width and memory depth can be adjusted via parameters in the Verilog code.
- **Status Flags**: The FIFO provides `full` and `empty` flags to indicate when the buffer is full or empty.
- **Testbench Included**: A comprehensive testbench (`tb_fifo.v`) is included, which tests read/write operations and flag behavior.
- **Simulation Ready**: Designed to be easily simulated using tools like ModelSim, Vivado, or Quartus.

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fifo-verilog.git
cd fifo-verilog
Simulation Tools
You'll need a Verilog simulation tool to run the project, such as:

ModelSim
Vivado
Quartus
Make sure your simulator supports Verilog HDL and is properly installed on your machine.

Running the Simulation
To run the simulation, follow these steps:

Open your simulation tool (e.g., ModelSim, Vivado).
Add the Verilog files (fifo.v and tb_fifo.v) to your project.
Compile both the FIFO module (fifo.v) and the testbench (tb_fifo.v).
Run the simulation on tb_fifo.v. You should see the testbench run through various operations like writing and reading from the FIFO.
View the waveforms in the simulation viewer to analyze the FIFO's behavior.
Detailed Explanation
FIFO Module
The FIFO module (fifo.v) is parameterized with DATA_WIDTH and ADDR_WIDTH. These parameters control the width of the data and the depth of the FIFO. It supports the following signals:

clk: Clock signal
rst: Reset signal
wr_en: Write enable signal
rd_en: Read enable signal
din: Data input
dout: Data output
full: High when FIFO is full
empty: High when FIFO is empty
Basic Functionality
Writing to the FIFO:

When wr_en is high and the FIFO is not full, the input data (din) is written to the memory.
The write pointer (wr_ptr) is incremented.
Reading from the FIFO:

When rd_en is high and the FIFO is not empty, data is read from the memory and output through dout.
The read pointer (rd_ptr) is incremented.
Status Flags:

full is set when the FIFO is completely filled.
empty is set when there is no data to read.
Testbench
The testbench (tb_fifo.v) simulates typical FIFO operations, including:

Writing data into the FIFO.
Reading data from the FIFO.
Handling edge cases such as trying to write when the FIFO is full and reading when it is empty.
The testbench also prints useful information to the console to help you track the FIFO's state during simulation.

Parameters
The FIFO's data width and depth are controlled by parameters in the Verilog code:

verilog
Copy code
parameter DATA_WIDTH = 8;  // Data width (8-bit)
parameter ADDR_WIDTH = 4;  // Address width (depth = 2^ADDR_WIDTH)
DATA_WIDTH: Defines the width of the data stored in the FIFO.
ADDR_WIDTH: Defines the depth of the FIFO as a power of 2 (i.e., 2^ADDR_WIDTH).
Simulation Waveform
Once you run the simulation in your tool (e.g., ModelSim or Vivado), you can view the waveform of signals like clk, rst, wr_en, rd_en, din, dout, full, and empty.

How to Save the Waveform as an Image
In the waveform window, adjust the time frame to fit the desired view.
Right-click in the waveform window and select Export or Save As Image (depending on your tool).
Choose the format (e.g., PNG, JPEG) and save the waveform image to your desired location.
This will allow you to visually inspect how the FIFO responds over time, as data is written and read.

Simulation Tools
You will need a Verilog simulation tool to run the project. Recommended tools include:

ModelSim
Vivado
Quartus
Ensure the tool you choose supports Verilog HDL and is properly installed.

Running the Simulation
Open your simulation tool (ModelSim, Vivado, Quartus, etc.).
Add the Verilog files (fifo.v and tb_fifo.v) to your project.
Compile the Verilog files.
Run the simulation on the testbench (tb_fifo.v).
View the results in the simulation console and waveform viewer.
Detailed Explanation
FIFO Module
The FIFO module (fifo.v) is implemented with the following features:

Parameterized Design: Supports configurable data width and memory depth.
Signals:
clk: Clock signal
rst: Reset signal
wr_en: Write enable signal
rd_en: Read enable signal
din: Data input
dout: Data output
full: High when FIFO is full
empty: High when FIFO is empty
Functionality:

Write Operation: Data is written to the FIFO when wr_en is high, and the FIFO is not full.
Read Operation: Data is read from the FIFO when rd_en is high, and the FIFO is not empty.
Status Flags: full and empty flags indicate the FIFO's status.
Testbench
The testbench (tb_fifo.v) is designed to:

Write multiple values into the FIFO.
Read values from the FIFO and print them.
Test edge cases, such as writing when full and reading when empty.
Parameters
The FIFO's behavior is controlled by the following parameters:

DATA_WIDTH: Defines the width of the data bus (e.g., 8 bits).
ADDR_WIDTH: Defines the depth of the FIFO as a power of 2 (e.g., 2^4 = 16 locations).
Example parameters:

verilog
Copy code
parameter DATA_WIDTH = 8;  // Data width in bits
parameter ADDR_WIDTH = 4;  // Address width (depth = 2^ADDR_WIDTH)
Simulation Waveform
After running the simulation, you can view the waveform for signals like clk, rst, wr_en, rd_en, din, dout, full, and empty. This helps verify the FIFO's functionality.

Exporting the Waveform
Adjust the View: Zoom and pan to the desired section of the waveform.
Export the Image:
In ModelSim: Go to File > Export > Image.
In Vivado: Right-click in the waveform window and select Export.
In Quartus: Use the screenshot tool or external tools if necessary.
